## (s)frxUSD Upgrade Modification
On Jan 24, 2025 the Frax team decided to modify the upgrade strategy as follows:

### Resume Bridging
#### 1. Reject pending, reverse submitted txs ((s)frxUSD)
- Legacy bridging resumes for (s)FRAX between legacy chains
- (Sei, Mode, X-Layer) remain fully operational
#### 2. Enable Legacy exit liquidity to Fraxtal ((s)frxUSD)
Connect Legacy OFTS (Base, Blast, Metis) to Fraxtal (s)frxUSD lockboxes
#### 3. Connect new upgradeable (Ink, etc.) to ethereum lockboxes (all 6 assets)
From this, ethereum lockboxes can bridge to/from Ink, Arbitrum, etc.
#### 4. Connect old upgradeable (X-Layer, Sei, Mode) OFTs to Fraxtal ((s)frxUSD)
From this, upgradeable liquidity can exit to Fraxtal
